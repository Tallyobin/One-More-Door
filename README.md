SECTION C: DIAGRAMMING QUESTIONS (2 QUESTIONS, 25 MARKS)

Instruction: Please answer ALL the questions.

Question 1
Develop a DFD level 0 for LLM computer equipment ordering system, which is
described in the following narrative.

When the system receives a purchase order from its customer, it will verify the
customer’s membership by referring to member info in the member file. If the customer
is not an active member, the system will reject the order by sending an order reject
notice to the customer. If the customer is an active member, the order will be accepted
and it will then serve as input for the process of filling up order. This process will then
generate picking list and forward it to the warehouse staff. Once the stocks have been
packed by warehouse staff, a completed order form will be submitted by the warehouse
staff. This form will serve as an input to activate the process of creating invoice. An
invoice will then be sent to the customer, besides being updated into the account
receivable file. A customer can make payment upon receiving the invoice. The payment
will be accepted by the process of applying payment, which also requires invoice details
from the account receivable file. The following outputs will be returned, upon
completing the process of applying payment: (i) payment details will be updated back
to the account receivable data store, (11) commission will be sent to the sales department,
(111) cash receipt entry will be issued to the accounting department. The system can also
generate sales report, upon receiving the report request from the supervisor. The sales

report details are retrieved from the account receivable file.

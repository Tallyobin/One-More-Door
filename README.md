**Prepare a Functional Decomposition Diagram(FDD) based on the case scenario given below. You need to draw the FDD on a piece of paper. Take photo of your work and save as JPEG, JPG, GIF, BMP, PNG or PDF. Upload the file in the given area here.** <br>

**Case scenario** <br>

You had interviewed Mr Tahir Suhaimi who is the Operation Senior Manager, ITMS, UNITEN. From the interview session, these are the details you gathered about the classrooms booking process. Change the details by structuring the requirements using FDD (swimlane flowchart).<br>

1. Lecturers make their bookings using the booking system online. Lecturers need to login into the system.<br>
2. Lecturers need to first identify the date and timeslot for class. The system will display a selection of available classrooms. However, if there are no available classrooms, the system will ask the lecturers to choose another date and timeslot or end the process.<br>
3. Lecturers must accept only one option. A notification will be sent to lecturers as successful booking.<br>
4. For all successful booking, the technician will receive the same notification. The technician has to make sure the classrooms are in working order. If there is any problem, the technician can cancel the booking, and a notification will be sent to the lecturers. If there is no problem, a virtual key will be given to lecturers to use the classrooms.<br>
5. Once lecturers complete using the classrooms, lecturers need to end the booking process by pressing the COMPLETE button in the system.<br>
